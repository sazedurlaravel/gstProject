                <p style="text-align: justify">Earlier, a student had to take the entrance exam in many universities to get admission in the university.

                    This year admission to 22 general and science and technology universities of Bangladesh will have to take part in a cluster examination.

                    Admission test will be held simultaneously in these 22 universities.

                    This is the 2nd time admission test is going to be conducted at the general and technical university level in Bangladesh. However, many lack a clear idea about how this exam will be conducted and how a student will get admission in the university of his choice.

                    Of the 22 universities that have merged, one is Jagannath University.

                    Mizanur Rahman, the joint convener of the committee consisting of the vice-chancellor of this university and the vice-chancellors of cluster universities, said that the examination will be held simultaneously in three separate departments - science, business education and humanities - for three days in all the campuses of the university.

                    This exam will be conducted in MCQ i.e. multiple choice mode. And in this case total marks will be 100 in each subject.

                    In order to apply in batch system, CGPA score of more than 3 in each of these two exams, SSC and HSC. Those who score less than this in one of the tests will not be able to appear in the university entrance examination.

                    In this case, science department students should have 7 in SSC and HSC, 6.5 for business education department and 6 for humanities department. That is, to participate in the entrance exam, this minimum score must be obtained.

                    It is informed by the committee regarding admission test in batch system, to get admission in the preferred university, one has to participate in the batch test first.



                    In order to get admission in the university of choice in this system, one has to first appear in an integrated examination (cluster system). In this method students will be given a mark between 0-100.

                    After receiving this number, each university will issue admission notification separately mentioning its own rules, features and conditions.




                    For example Mr. Wahiduzzaman said that only those who have passed HSC in 2020-21 will be given admission in Jagannath University. Those who have passed in the previous year i.e. 2020 will not be given the opportunity.

                    The student has to see which university he is eligible for admission as per the conditions of the admission notification, then he has to apply to the respective university.

                    He said, in this case, universities must take care whether their conditions are fulfilled or not.

                    He said, those who will be ahead in batch exam marks and SSC and HSC scores will get priority in admission.

                    However, what will be done if more applications are submitted than the number of seats in the same category or subject in accordance with all the conditions - Mr. Wahiduzzaman said that in this case a merit list will be prepared.

                    "But in this case no more tests will be taken separately," he said.

                    In the preparation of merit list in universities, the marks of cluster system, marks of SSC and HSC examination and the number of marks obtained by the student in various subjects will also be taken into consideration.

                    Those who will be at the beginning of the merit list created in this way, will get the opportunity to study the relevant subjects of the respective university.

                    In this regard, he said that in order to study in many subjects, the minimum number of marks to be obtained in a particular subject is mentioned in many cases. In that case, even if a student has high total marks, if he does not have the prescribed marks in that particular subject, then he will not be able to study in that subject.

                    Some other public universities including Dhaka University will conduct admission test separately

                    He said that students can apply to any university by taking into account the scores obtained in the examination in the cluster system and the admission advertisements given by the universities with various conditions.

                    "If a student wants to and has a good score, he can apply for admission in any university. If the score is low, he can't,".
